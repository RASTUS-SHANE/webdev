         <p id="font">As of now, we have a little bit idea of the role of HTML. We also know it is a markup language. But the question is why it is considered as a markup language, not a programming language? To answer this question, first of all, let me tell you, whatever kind of content we see on a page, it can be anything maybe a paragraph or an image, or a video or a button or anything, to show all these types of content in a browser, HTML is responsible. To see any kind of content in a page we will have to send through HTML only. We need to wrap the content inside HTML, only then the browser will understand what kind of content you are sending. This wrapping the content inside HTML is known as markup. Okay, let's take an example to make it more clear.Just consider an article in a newspaper. If you have been asked just mark up each and every section in the article. Obviously, you will start from the top, for heading section, you will say it as a heading, then some paragraphs, if there will be any image you will say it as an image, then again maybe few more paragraphs, or maybe some quotes inside the article. I will also do the same thing. That's exactly what HTML does. HTML mark up every type of content with the help of elements, tags, and attributes available inside it. So, whatever kind of content we want in a page, we will mark it up with the help of available elements and tags in HTML.
            Now we all know how the content is displayed in a page. We also saw how the content is marked up in an article. Exactly, to markup different kind of content in HTML we use a different kind of elements. For e.g.: for a paragraph, we have a 'p' element, for an image we have 'img' element, for an article we have 'article' element. We have lots of element based on kind of content, we have div, section, header, nav, button, etc.
